										<h1>evolutionary trajectory</h1>
									</header>
									<p>A rivers response to changing flux conditions and disturbance events can be used to determine a range of evolutionary trajectories (Brierley and Fryirs, 2016). River evolution is dependent on river flow, sediment availability and resistance elements along the river planform. These geomorphic features have both spatial and temporal variability, characterising the rivers range of variability. Scorpio et al., (2015) studied the evolutionary trajectories of three rivers in Italy by digitizing aerial photographs through ArcGIS. From this historical analysis, it was found that in the 1980's river incision was most prominent due to human disturbance, simplifying the river ecosystem by reducing sediment availability.</p>
                                    <br>
									<p>Through analysing the evolutionary trajectories, it provided Scorpio et al., (2015) insight into degradational and recovery traits to guide management actions compatible with channel adjustment. In a similar study, Surian, Zilian, Comiti, Lenzi and Mo (2009) used GIS principles to explore the temporal and spatial variability of gravel bed rivers. Based on the rivers temporal and spatial variability, evolutionary trends showed that channel recovery is ongoing in all rivers despite dams constraining sediment fluxes. Both case studies suggest that channel adjustments have been induced by human intervention, providing a gap for innovative future river management procedures where natural river variability is at the forefront of river management frameworks.</p>

										<h1>space to move</h1>
									</header>
									<p>A river is confined by valley setting, infrastructure, land owners and management activities which in turn affects its space to move (Brierley, 2017). Norris (2017) explains that the ability for a rivers space to move means that it can respond to catchment wide disturbances as appropriate, by consuming its own energy. Space to move initiatives have been adapted globally in river management frameworks in hope to shift from a command control approach to a holistic process based approach.</p>
                                    <br>
									<p>Passive restoration approaches such as riparian vegetation planting (Beechie et al., 2010) reduce consequences of ecological degradation and breaching of hard flood protection infrastructure (Brierley, 2017). As these hard infrastructures are minimised, the river is able to self-heal through passive management (Kondolf, 2011). Drawing on Brierley (2017), space to move is also known as 'erodible corridor' or 'freedom space' which sets aside space for the complex physical processes of the river including sediment transport, erosion and deposition in order to maintain the rivers complex form. It is therefore said that through space to move initiatives where the river is able to adjust on its own terms without artificial confinement, the river increases its resilience to land use change. However, in order for a river to self-adjust, it must first have sufficient room to move and sufficient sediment load to maintain channel complexity. This is difficult to maintain in a highly populated environment where space to move initiatives are limited (Brierley, 2017). Piegay et al., (2006) compares photographs from 19th to 20th century to reveal how the Rhone River, France has decreased its space to move during the 20th century. With the decrease of braided rivers on the valley floor and implementation of flood protection measures, the changing land use has decreased the rivers erodible corridor. This development has resulted in a large sediment deficit, confining and incising the river up to 14m as of 1994. This example aligns with the theory of Brierley (2017) who discusses that it is difficult to balance cost effective river management without compromising the complexities of river ecosystems.

                                    The stopbanks on the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada, reduce the migration of the channel, restricting the rivers access to the floodplains and increasing channel flows (Piegay et al., 2006). Thus, by allowing the channel to widen through bank erosion and re-establishing hydraulic connections (Piegay et al., 2006), engineered flood protection can be replaced with approaches to improve ecological river conditions Fryirs (2015). As space to move initiatives become more frequent in management frameworks, an understanding of potential future trajectories of the river is required for effective river management strategies.</p>

										<h1>range of variability</h1>
									</header>
									<p>When defining the range of variability of a river, we must first distinguish between river change and river behaviour (Lisenby and Fryirs 2016). River change refers to a shift in river type whereas river behaviour refers to natural adjustments that occur (Brierley and Fryirs, 2005). Lisenby and Fryirs (2016) use the capacity for a rivers future geomorphic channel adjustment to determine the range of variability of a river. In comparison, Wohl (2011) uses the term 'historical range of variability' to describe variability in flow regime and channel planform prior to human alteration. Through understanding the range of variability of a river, it is possible to characterize the future behaviour of a fluvial system.</p>
                     
									<p>River behaviour may expand or contract over time (Brierley and Fryirs, 2016). Therefore, its behaviour is determined by the capacity for the river to adjust in the space it has available (Fryirs, Brierley and Erskine, 2012). By characterising the historical channel shift, the rivers range of variability can be used to inform possible future trajectories of the system. This was used in Lisenby and Fryirs (2016) who studied the history of channel adjustment over a 130-year time period in the 3 largest tributaries of the Lockyer Creek, Queensland, Australia. This study was carried out by observing geomorphic adjustments in the tributaries and relating them to form, frequency and location in the reach to predict future expectations of channel adjustment.

                                    Despite the similarities to past channel adjustments, Wohl (2011) explains that we cannot recreate historical river conditions even if they are well known due to the fluctuating equilibrium of a river. Brierley and Fryirs (2016) also recognise that there can be multiple future states of a river as they are complex and ever changing. With this in mind, adaptive future management principles are essential for effective river management. Through this adaptive management, a guideline for potential space to move initiatives can be successfully implemented (Hillman and Brierley, 2005). Wohl (2011) also notes that effective implementation of a new holistic approach requires an understanding of the natural pathways and rates of sediment movement.

                                    It is with this theoretical basis in mind, that a historical analysis of the Otaki River is beneficial to provide insight into future trajectories and potential space to move management initiatives for Aotearoa.</p>
